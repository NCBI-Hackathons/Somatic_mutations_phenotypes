# Somatic mutations phenotypes

A pipeline for association of genetic features and phenotypes

Current methods for estimating the association of genetic variants with survival have limitations.

The goal is to estimate the association of genetic variants with survival (time from diagnosis/treatment to clinical event) or benefit from therapy.

In this project, we will implement a possibly improved method for analysis using Bayesian survival models estimated using Stan. The resulting package will make it easier for researchers to fit Bayesian survival models to genetic data.
